;;; custom-template.el --- Template for machine-specific customizations
;;; Commentary:
;; This is a template for your machine-specific custom.el file.
;; Copy this to ~/.emacs.d/custom.el and modify as needed.
;; This file is NOT tracked in git - it's for local customizations only.

;;; Code:

(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 
 ;; Example customizations (uncomment and modify as needed):
 ;; '(user-full-name "Your Name")
 ;; '(user-mail-address "your.email@example.com")
 )

(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
